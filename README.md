### What’s this site about?
I plan to use this GitHub Home Page [jnbvd7.github.io](https://jnbvd7.github.io) to document some data science projects in [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Julia](http://julialang.org/) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
### Who this site is for?  
For me, as a reference, but may be useful for those with little or no coding background interested in data science, and/or those interested in technical and scientific computing. 
### Contact  
My email contact is on my GitHub profile page: [https://github.com/jnbvd7/](https://github.com/jnbvd7/)
